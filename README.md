The requirement is to have a working password generating website. That generates a password based on user's selection criteria.

My website consists of:

a) when user clicks on " generate password", prompt comes up for user to enter the length of password

b) If the entered length of the password is less than 8 or more than 128 characters, prompt comes up that user needs to enter length between 8 and 128 characters

c) Validate the input to be a number

d) once valid length is entered, the prompts comes up to confirm:

          i) If the password must have lower character
          
          ii) If the password must have upper character
          
          iii) if the password must have a number
          
          iv) if the password must have special character
          
e) based on what prompts the user confirms for the password will for sure generate password with those specifications

f) If none of these specifications are selected, the alert message will appear and password box will show "Please try again by selecting atleast one specifications"

g) Console logs captures the inputs and also validates at the end that requested length matches the final password length

h) Final password displays into the passweor box
